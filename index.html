        Hello! Thanks for visiting the site. Let me take a few sentences to help you understand who I am. I'm married
        and have lived and raised a family in the central Florida region for over 24 years. I've worked at various
        capacities in an IT/data-processing environment for the last 35 years. The last 22 years I've worked as an
        application developer at Walt Disney World Parks & Resorts. I spent most of that time at Disney as a backend
        developer working with guest data in both a transactional and batch context. I'm presently honing my backend
        computing skills and acquiring front-end skills through the "full-stack" training BootCamp provided at the
        University of Central Florida. This portfolio contains a cross-section of projects I've authored at the BootCamp,
        highlighting the full-stack skill set.  My past experience is documented in the </p><a href="assets/docs/markdale_2021.docx">Resume</a><p style="display: inline">.  Please contact me if
        you have any questions, or would like to converse. I'd love to hear from you.
      </p>
